Employee attrition poses a significant challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and disruptions in team performance. High turnover can indicate deeper organizational issues such as dissatisfaction, lack of engagement, or misalignment between employee expectations and company culture.

This HR analytics dashboard is designed to address the critical question:
What are the key factors contributing to employee attrition within the company?

The dashboard utilizes employee data — including gender, job roles, satisfaction levels, compensation, work-life balance, and performance indicators — to identify patterns and trends associated with attrition. The objective is to provide HR leaders and decision-makers with actionable insights by:

Analyzing how factors such as age, department, job role, salary, and years at the company influence attrition.

Highlighting departments or roles with the highest attrition rates.

Correlating employee satisfaction metrics (e.g., job satisfaction, environment satisfaction) with attrition behavior.
